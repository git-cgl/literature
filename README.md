## Testing Classical Asset Pricing Theories

This paper empirically tests the theoretical predictions of CCAPM. Its main findings are surprising and disappointing: though theoretically powerful and intuitively pleasing, CCAPM fits the real economy poorly. It cannot justify the low average risk-free rate and high average return on equity with a reasonable choice of parameters. It suggests that heterogeneity, non-time-additivity separable preferences or trading costs may resolve this puzzle.
