# A Review of Selected Literatures on Asset Pricing

## Testing Classical Asset Pricing Theories

1. [The Equity Premium: A Puzzle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304393285900613) @ Mehra and Prescott (1985)

This paper empirically tests the theoretical predictions of CCAPM. Its main findings are surprising and disappointing: though theoretically powerful and intuitively pleasing, CCAPM fits the real economy poorly. It cannot justify the low average risk-free rate and high average return on equity with a reasonable choice of parameters. It suggests that heterogeneity, non-time-additivity separable preferences or trading costs may resolve this puzzle.

## Theory of Robust Control and Ambiguity

1. [Robust Control and Model Uncertainty](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.2.60) @ Hansen and Sargent (2001, AER)

This paper describes links between the max-min expected utility theory and the applications of robust-control theory. Observational equivalence results are obtained that the multiplier and constraint robust-control problems give rise to the same decisions.
